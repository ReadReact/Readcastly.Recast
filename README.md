## The Team and tech stack:

ReadCast.ly was conceived, architected and built in 4 weeks as the thesis product of four full-stack software engineers at Hack Reactor in New York City: Michiya Hibino, Viswada Yangala, John Packel and Andrew Fechner. 

ReadCast.ly employs 4 APIs to pull data from 60+ news sources, parse the text, convert to mp3 audio and then store and stream from Amazon S3 to the in-app player. 

The team also wrote custom algorithms to further cleanse the text and ensure a quality listening experience, and they built a flexible SQL database that enables powerful relational look-ups between users and their preferences, articles and news sources and audio file distribution methods.
