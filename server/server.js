The usual response to my mild equivocation was to look at me incredulously. It&#x2019;s become an article of faith among my friends across the political spectrum that Brexit is quite obviously a disaster, an incomprehensible, xenophobic act of self-harm on Britain&#x2019;s account. That unalloyed view seems to me to be a failure on the American media&#x2019;s part. They&#x2019;ve never really explained why a sane Brit might have voted to leave the bloc. So let me suggest one.</p>\n<p class=\"clay-paragraph\">Or, rather, let my brother. He and my dad voted to leave, and I asked my brother to explain. It was really quite simple, he said. He believed that immigration into Britain was happening at too fast a pace. He saw overcrowded schools and hospitals, a groaning transportation system, an acute housing shortage, and a country that had been transformed so fast many of its inhabitants began to not recognize it at all. He wanted immigration to come down to more manageable levels &#x2014; and, in the last election, he therefore voted Conservative, because that&#x2019;s what the Tories promised. They pledged to bring immigration down to the tens of thousands a year. But after a year in office, <a href=\"https://www.migrationwatchuk.org/statistics-net-migration-statistics/#create-graph\">the immigration statistics </a>showed no drop at all: Over 600,000 migrants were still entering the U.K. per year, with close to 300,000 from the EU, and there was no end in sight. That number <a href=\"http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/unmaking-england/\">was completely unprecedented</a> before 2014, but had stayed at that level for three years in a row. For a comparison, EU immigration into Britain was a mere 44,000 in 1992 and 66,000 in 2003.</p>\n<p class=\"clay-paragraph\">When David Cameron was asked why he had not kept his promise, he essentially argued that he couldn&#x2019;t. Being in the EU meant no control over European migration to the U.K. And so my brother concluded that, because of the EU, it made no difference which party he voted for. On a key and legitimate issue of public concern, immigration levels, centuries of English democracy counted for nothing. My brother had held the quaint view that if you dislike the policies of one party in government, you can always vote them out to get an alternative. But he soon realized that, on most issues concerning the EU, his vote counted for nothing. In other words, he voted to leave the EU because he believed in democracy. It&#x2019;s not an accident that the winning slogan of the Leave campaign last year was &#x201C;Take Back Control.&#x201D;</p>\n<p class=\"clay-paragraph\">They had a point. Democracy works best at the level of the nation-state. Just ask the Greeks, now neck-deep in an EU-mandated austerity program, and denied a chance to devalue their own currency, and restore their economy, because they joined the euro. And this, of course, is also the left-wing critique of the EU. Its neoliberal economics and austere Central Bank stymie any national attempt to control trade, currency, interest rates, immigration and thereby the economy. So left-of-center governments have no choice but to bow down to free-market, pro-austerity policies imposed by Brussels. That is one reason that Margaret Thatcher, despite profound hostility to a European super-state, nonetheless was an enthusiast for the single tariff-free market. It was a way, in her view, to keep socialism and social democracy permanently in their place. <a href=\"http://hurryupharry.org/2016/06/20/why-i-am-voting-leave-by-professor-alan-johnson/\">Here&#x2019;s lefty professor Alan Johnson</a>, incensed by how Brussels controls democratically elected national governments:</p>\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote\">The crisis of the eurozone from 2010 even led to the removal of elected governments and their replacement with compliant technocrats&#x2014;by the troika of the EU, the European Central Bank, and the IMF. The markets were kept happy, and the euro was kept intact, but the price was high: democracy was &#x2018;discarded like unwanted clothing&#x2019; as the BBC Europe editor, Gavin Hewitt, put it in his valuable book The Lost Continent. More: the European welfare state was eroded; deflation, mass unemployment, poverty, and ugly and sometimes violent political populisms disfigured the European landscape.</blockquote>\n<p class=\"clay-paragraph\">The EU is, from the perspective of history, a wonderful thing. It has kept the peace; it&#x2019;s thrilling to be able to travel across the Continent without a passport. But in the last 20 years or so, it has massively overreached, leaving many Europeans with a serious democratic deficit. It has a &#x201C;parliament,&#x201D; but barely anything is decided there. The European Commission is where the action is &#x2014; and its commissioners are selected by member governments, not directly elected. The European Central Bank controls interest rates &#x2014; and it&#x2019;s controlled by the Germans. Changes to the EU&#x2019;s treaties &#x2014; always in a pro-federal direction &#x2014; have been relentlessly imposed from above. A handful of countries have actually held referendums to acquiesce to new Treaty changes, but every time, the results have either been papered over, or the referendum has been repeated so that the people eventually get the decision right. (The Irish, for example, first voted to reject the Lisbon Treaty in 2008. They had to repeat the referendum a year later and got a yes. Most other countries never gave their citizens a voice at all.)</p>\n<figure class=\"mediaplay-image horizontal \">\n\n  <div class=\"image-wrapper\">\n      <img class=\"img-data\" srcset=\"http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/30/30-brexit-theresa-may-tv.w710.h473.jpg 1x, http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/30/30-brexit-theresa-may-tv.w710.h473.2x.jpg 2x\" src=\"http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/30/30-brexit-theresa-may-tv.w710.h473.jpg%201x,%20http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/30/30-brexit-theresa-may-tv.w710.h473.2x.jpg%202x\" alt=\"Image\">\n  </div>\n    <figcaption class=\"mediaplay-image-figcaption\">\n      <span class=\"caption\">British Prime Minister Theresa May.</span>\n      <span class=\"buffer\"></span>\n      <cite class=\"credit\">Photo: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty Images</cite>\n    </figcaption>\n  \n</figure>\n<p class=\"clay-paragraph\">For a fiercely independent island like Britain, this Brussels hegemony would always rankle. The Brits didn&#x2019;t defeat Germany in the Second World War only to have Germany control the British economy decades later. But unprecedented mass immigration from the Continent fueled the discontent. Imagine if NAFTA mandated that every Mexican and Canadian citizen had a right to live and work in the U.S. &#x2014; and the Congress had no ability to say no! But that was what Brits have now dealt with for decades.</p>\n<p class=\"clay-paragraph\">And unlike America, Britain, a small island, does not have a long history of mass immigration. Far from it. For centuries its population remained almost unchanged. In point of fact, Britain now gets more immigrants in a single year than it did in the entire period from 1066 to 1950. But when Prime Minister David Cameron asked Angela Merkel for some kind of brake on this unprecedented influx, he was told to go jump in the Channel. Meanwhile, mass immigration from non-EU countries has already transformed British culture at an extremely un-British pace. The most popular name for baby boys in Britain <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2014/12/02/is-mohammed-really-the-most-common-baby-name-in-britain/?utm_term=.dd6f6b2ff7fa\">is now</a> &#x2026; Muhammed. It turns out, as Ben Schwarz elaborates, that there will not always be an England, at least an England as anyone before the 21st century would have understood it.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"clay-paragraph\">Hence the nationalist uprising. Leaving the EU, it seems to me, is still a bad solution to the erosion of traditional national identity. It will be a blow to the British economy, and it also threatens the United Kingdom itself, as pro-EU Scotland now wants a new referendum on secession. My own view is that Britain had the best of all EU worlds before Brexit: It had the free market to sell its goods in, but was exempted from the euro, parts of the Lisbon Treaty, and the European bank. The Brits could have argued for more national autonomy from within the bloc, and maybe could have gotten Merkel to budge. More to the point, Brexit does not even guarantee that immigration levels will decline from now on, as Theresa May was forced to concede last Wednesday in the Commons. It will have no effect on non-EU immigration, for example, which is about as high as that from the EU. And several sectors in the economy &#x2014; such as health care &#x2014; desperately need EU immigrants, and exceptions are going to be made in the tortuous divorce proceedings that began this week. When I point this out to my brother, he shrugs. At least immigration will henceforth be a matter of British policy, he notes, not EU diktats.</p>\n<p class=\"clay-paragraph\">It was democracy that was on the ballot in the Brexit referendum. In some ways, it seems admirable that 52 percent of Britons put democratic accountability before their economic interests &#x2014; even if they made the wrong decision. It takes pluck to do something like that. And the polling suggests that very few Brits have had second thoughts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"clay-paragraph\">Should the Dems filibuster Gorsuch? I get the case. It&#x2019;s important not to acquiesce to the Republican refusal to give Merrick Garland a hearing. Gorsuch is a classic judicial conservative in the mold of Scalia. He was at times evasive in the hearings. The Republicans so abused the filibuster for Obama&#x2019;s judicial picks that Harry Reid had to nuke it. Payback is an important tool so as not to incentivize future GOP  obstructionism. And so on.</p>\n<p class=\"clay-paragraph\">And yet, and yet &#x2026; removing the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees &#x2014; which could well happen if the Democrats refuse to give him enough of the 60 votes required &#x2014; is a worrying thing. It intensifies partisanship and polarization. It shreds a norm that both presidents and Congress have long obeyed. It politicizes the judiciary in a way that undermines liberal democracy at a time when liberal democracy is under considerable strain. It further erodes the civility that is critical for the American Constitution to work. It&#x2019;s something that, once done, is very hard to restore. Yes, I&#x2019;m a conservative on these matters &#x2014; with a small <i>c</i>.</p>\n<figure class=\"mediaplay-image horizontal \">\n\n  <div class=\"image-wrapper\">\n      <img class=\"img-data\" srcset=\"http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/30/30-neil-gorsuch-hearing.w710.h473.jpg 1x, http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/30/30-neil-gorsuch-hearing.w710.h473.2x.jpg 2x\" src=\"http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/30/30-neil-gorsuch-hearing.w710.h473.jpg%201x,%20http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/30/30-neil-gorsuch-hearing.w710.h473.2x.jpg%202x\" alt=\"Image\">\n  </div>\n    <figcaption class=\"mediaplay-image-figcaption\">\n      <span class=\"caption\">Judge Neil Gorsuch.</span>\n      <span class=\"buffer\"></span>\n      <cite class=\"credit\">Photo: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images</cite>\n    </figcaption>\n  \n</figure>\n<p class=\"clay-paragraph\">But from a purely partisan Democratic point of view, a filibuster is also not so clearly a good idea either. Gorsuch&#x2019;s seat was occupied by Antonin Scalia. Almost any nominee to replace him would be less extreme. (We&#x2019;ve gone, for example, from Scalia&#x2019;s bilious dissents in defense of sodomy laws to Gorsuch&#x2019;s acknowledgment of gay marriage equality as a settled precedent.) Gorsuch is also one of the best on the Trump list of SCOTUS picks. The Court&#x2019;s basic contours would not be much changed. But in the event of a Ginsburg or Kennedy or Breyer vacancy, the stakes would be much, much higher. Better, it seems to me, to save the ultimate obstruction for a nominee who could shift the entire Court toward the right.</p>\n<p class=\"clay-paragraph\">I doubt the filibuster will survive, given the mood of the Democratic base and the partisanship of the GOP. But I&#x2019;m quite sure the norms of liberal democracy will take yet another hit. At some point, the stability of our political system should matter more than ideology.</p>\n\n\n<p class=\"clay-paragraph\">Here&#x2019;s another cat among the usual pigeons. In the renewed debate about free speech on campus, it has become de rigueur to argue that Charles Murray is a foul racist who believes, according to the New York <i>Times</i>, that African-Americans are &#x201C;inferior&#x201D; to whites &#x2014; but that free speech should extend even to raging bigots and pseudoscientists. But is the book racist hate speech? I actually read <i>The Bell Curve</i> twice in order to get to the bottom of this charge. And it is, to my mind, simply wrong.</p>\n<figure class=\"mediaplay-image horizontal \">\n\n  <div class=\"image-wrapper\">\n      <img class=\"img-data\" srcset=\"http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/30/30-charles-murray-protest-notre-dame.w710.h473.jpg 1x, http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/30/30-charles-murray-protest-notre-dame.w710.h473.2x.jpg 2x\" src=\"http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/30/30-charles-murray-protest-notre-dame.w710.h473.jpg%201x,%20http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/30/30-charles-murray-protest-notre-dame.w710.h473.2x.jpg%202x\" alt=\"Image\">\n  </div>\n    <figcaption class=\"mediaplay-image-figcaption\">\n      <span class=\"caption\">Notre Dame students protest an event featuring Charles Murray, a controversial conservative speaker, writer and academic, Tuesday, March 28, 2017.</span>\n      <span class=\"buffer\"></span>\n      <cite class=\"credit\">Photo: Robert Franklin/South Bend Tribune via AP</cite>\n    </figcaption>\n  \n</figure>\n<p class=\"clay-paragraph\">I recommend three pieces that elucidate what was actually in the book (that most of its critics have not read). Here&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://quillette.com/2017/03/27/a-tale-of-two-bell-curves/\">an independent review of the book,</a> which shows that Murray and Richard Herrnstein were reiterating what is simply undeniable and mainstream among experts in the field. Here<a href=\"https://www.aei.org/publication/charles-murrays-splc-page-as-edited-by-charles-murray/\"> is Murray&#x2019;s own response</a> to the widely disseminated smears published by the Southern Poverty Law Center. And <a href=\"http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.134.1282&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf\">here is a 1996 report </a>from the Board of Scientific Affairs of the American Psychological Association that examined, in the wake of the original controversy, whether Murray and Herrnstein were outside the mainstream science on intelligence. It&#x2019;s called &#x201C;Intelligence: Knowns and Unknowns.&#x201D; It was written by experts from Yale, Howard, Cornell, and Emory, among others.</p>\n<p class=\"clay-paragraph\">I still believe that the chapter on race was unnecessary for the thesis of the book. But I don&#x2019;t think it was racist or pseudoscience. If you have an opinion on <i>The Bell Curve</i>, see if you keep it after reading these three pieces.</p>\n\n      \n    </div></div>",

It&#x2019;s been 18 years since the <em>MST3K</em> bozos last watched a bad movie in space for our enjoyment, and this revival features Felicia Day and Patton Oswalt in prominent new roles, along with writing contributions from Dan Harmon and Joel McHale, plus the original cast returning in some capacity for this 14-episode season. Despite what appears to be a deliberately &#x2019;90s-DI-throwback look, layering clever commentary on top of a little-seen B-movie subculture has new resonance in an era where everyone and their brother has an ironic movie podcast and a desire to connect with strangers via weird entertainment.

But the movie is one of those magic accidents of cinema: a rousing adventure that&#x2019;s also a family-friendly meditation on the perils of growing up (even if the sidekicks, a monkey voiced by Charlize Theron and a beetle played by Matthew McConaughey, do grate on the nerves after a bit).

In <em>The Tenth Man</em>, a 30-something neurotic man named Ariel returns home to Buenos Aires&#x2019;s self-contained Jewish neighborhood after a long absence. He&#x2019;s hoping to speak to his father, who runs a local foundation, but dad keeps distracting him with random acts of charity to complete.

And while cable TV can dominate the president&#x2019;s mood and set the agenda for senior administration staff, Kushner usually keeps his large flat-screen TV in his office turned off, a stark departure from other top aides. </p>\n<p>Kushner, the president&#x2019;s 36-year-old son-in-law and White House senior adviser, does essentially what he wants, having the benefit of not only Trump&apos;s ear but &#x2014; as a family member &#x2014; his implicit trust.</p><p class=\"story-continued\">Story Continued Below</p>\n\n <p>That trust has resulted in a vast portfolio that so far includes negotiating an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal, helping oversee relations with Canada, China and Mexico and, as of this week, reinventing the federal government through the new White House Office of American Innovation. </p>\n<p>But Kushner&apos;s status as the big-issue guru has stoked resentment among his colleagues, who question whether Kushner is capable of following through on his various commitments. And some colleagues complain that his dabbling in myriad issues and his tendency to walk in and out of meetings have complicated efforts to instill more order and organization into the chaotic administration. These people also say Kushner can be a shrewd self promoter, knowing how to take credit &#x2014; and shirk blame &#x2014; whenever it suits him. </p>\n<p>&#x201C;He&apos;s saving the government and the Middle East at the same time,&#x201D; one senior administration official quipped.</p>\n<p>In addition to being arguably the president&#x2019;s most trusted and influential adviser, Kushner also serves as Trump&#x2019;s unofficial hatchet man. And all eyes are on Kushner as White House insiders predict a broader staff shakeup amid rising tensions between Kushner and White House chief strategist Steve Bannon.</p>\n<p> Kushner would like to present Trump a plan for improving the White House within weeks, around the 90-day mark, according to a person familiar with the plan. </p>\n<p>In a move that&apos;s alarming the West Wing&apos;s hardline conservatives, Kushner is increasingly aligning himself with national economic adviser Gary Cohn, who&#x2019;s participating in Kushner&#x2019;s innovation office and a Democrat whose moderate political positions in some ways mirror Kushner&#x2019;s own. </p><aside class=\"story-related \">\n    <aside class=\"content-group inline-module-playbook\">\n        <section class=\"speedbump layout-bi\">\n        <div class=\"speedbump-item pos-alpha\">\n            <div class=\"spotlight spotlight--flex\">\n                \n            </div>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"speedbump-item pos-beta\">\n            <div class=\"js-tealium-newsletter\">\n                <div class=\"dari-frame dari-frame-loaded\">\n                            <p class=\"legal-disclaimer\">By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

Kushner is &#x201C;the ultimate decider. Mostly people are jealous.&quot;</p>\n<p>This account of Kushner&apos;s role is based on more than a dozen interviews with senior White House officials, allies, donors, lawmakers and others. </p>\n<p>White House chief of staff Reince Priebus said Kushner has been an asset to the Trump administration. &#x201C;Jared has been a top advisor to the president from the beginning. Using his wealth of private-sector experience, he is always finding innovative solutions to our country&#x2019;s biggest problems.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Kushner spends his days bopping from meetings on Capitol Hill to pacing the Oval Office with Trump to calling Trump&apos;s friends and potential media allies, like morning show host Joe Scarborough. He involves himself in high-level discussions on all manner of policy priorities, ranging from health care and tax reform to trade policy. In foreign policy, he&#x2019;s been publicly tasked with solving Middle East peace, while also handling Canada, China and Mexico issues. </p>\n<p>He created the innovation office last week &#x2014; which is amorphous but designed to save the government money, improve technology and reduce bureaucracy, officials say. He is particularly interested in large infrastructure projects, a senior administration official said. </p>\n<p>The creation of the office added to a perception around the White House that Kushner&#x2019;s portfolio is almost impossibly ambitious, and that he prefers big-picture discussions to the sometimes mundane and detail-oriented work involved in carrying out policy changes. </p>\n<p>On Wednesday, White House staffers and outside allies passed around a story from the parody website The Onion indicating that Kushner had &#x201C;quietly moved the task &#x2018;solve Middle East crisis&#x2019; to his to-do list for next week&#x201D; because &#x201C;there was simply too much on his plate right now to bring stability to the fractious region by end of day Friday.&#x201D; Kushner did not see the piece, a person close to him said. </p>\n<p>Yet he is frequently the last person Trump speaks to at night. He spends most weekends with his father-in-law, traveling to Florida aboard Air Force One. Last week, he called lawmakers from a vacation in Aspen, Colo., as the health care bill went off the rails &#x2014; and, while several aides questioned his decision to go on holiday at such a critical time, Kushner was the one who went to dinner with the president the day after the bill failed, joined by his wife Ivanka Trump--who is now also taking a formal position alongside her husband in her father&#x2019;s administration.</p>\n<p>Kushner&#x2019;s boosters see him as &#x201C;a visionary&#x201D; who is bringing to government a disruptive Silicon Valley mindset that helped him succeed in the technology and real estate industries, as well as on Trump&#x2019;s unconventional presidential campaign.</p>\n<p>Kushner signed off on a mini-shakeup formalized on Thursday, when White House Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh packed her bags and headed to the non-profit group created to support Trump&#x2019;s agenda, sources familiar with the move said. His involvement with White House staffing echoes his role in orchestrating Trump&#x2019;s campaign, where Kushner was instrumental in the removals of Corey Lewandowski as campaign manager, as well as Paul Manafort as campaign chairman, and later New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie as transition chief, according to people involved in all three shakeups. </p>\n<p>Kushner has told people that he believes at least some of the resentment of him is being whipped up by people who worked on the campaign but didn&#x2019;t get the jobs in the White House, such as Lewandowski, as well as conservatives concerned that he&#x2019;s too liberal. </p>\n<p>Lewandowski did not respond to a request for comment, but Kushner&#x2019;s allies contend that Lewandowski and other critics have tried to plant negative stories about Kushner in the media. </p>\n<p> They point, for example, to a burst of inquiries from at least seven media outlets chasing a tip that Kushner was lobbying Trump to pardon Kushner&#x2019;s father Charles Kushner, who pleaded guilty in 2005 to tax evasion, witness tampering and making illegal campaign contributions. There&#x2019;s no evidence Jared Kushner sought such a pardon, and no media outlets have corroborated the rumor.</p><div class=\"story-interrupt pos-beta format-m \">\n    <aside class=\"interrupt-item\">\n<div class=\"story-media\">\n            <figure class=\"media-item type-photo\">\n                <div class=\"fig-graphic \">\n                    <img src=\"http://static.politico.com/dims4/default/1b69a95/2147483647/resize/658x%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fab%2F6c%2Fb42571e34b8686e67bc0a1887eec%2F170329-jared-kushner-ap-1160.jpg\" alt=\"Jared Kushner would like to present Trump a plan for improving the White House within weeks, around the 90-day mark, according to a person familiar with the plan.\"></div>\n                \n                </figure>\n        </div>\n</aside>\n    </div>\n<p> Kushner defenders argue that he has a moderate sensibility that benefits the White House. Kushner, for his part, believes striking middle ground means people are often going to be mad at him from all sides.</p>\n<p> But it&#x2019;s made him a target for those who believe Trump is being encouraged to jettison some of the promises that got him elected&#x2014;or adopt new positions at odds with what his Trump Train voters thought they were getting. Influential conservative talk show host Mark Levin has name-checked Kushner several times as a liberal influence in the White House, including late last month when Kushner reportedly was considering supporting a border adjustment tax proposal. Levin called the tax &#x201C;an old-time liberal Democrat protectionist&#x201D; policy and called Kushner &#x201C;some 32-year-old, liberal Democrat kid out of New York.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>When the White House is planning initiatives on those issues that might offend moderates, one of the senior administration officials said, &#x201C;You can expect to read the anonymous story that Jared and Ivanka are trying to stop it.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Others are more concerned about what Kushner hasn&#x2019;t done. One pro-Israel operative who works with the administration said &#x201C;there were high hopes&#x201D; that Kushner &#x2014; an Orthodox Jew and the grandson of Holocaust survivors, whose only picture in his office is of his grandparents &#x2014; &#x201C;was a guy who really understood our community&#x201D; when Trump tapped him as a point person on the Middle East. </p>\n<p>But, the operative said, those hopes mostly have been supplanted by &#x201C;deep concern that Jared is not the person we thought he was &#x2014; that this guy who is supposed to be good at everything is totally out of his depth.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Those concerns have been fueled by a series of disappointments, including Trump&#x2019;s equivocation on campaign trail pledges to move the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem and to support Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank, as well as his unwillingness to force personnel moves at the State Department sought by neoconservatives.</p>\n<p>Influential Jewish Republicans including the mega-donor casino billionaire Sheldon Adelson lobbied Kushner to convince Trump to appoint prominent neoconservative foreign policy hand Elliott Abrams as the No. 2 official in Foggy Bottom and to remove Michael Ratney, a State Department official who previously served as U.S. consul in Jerusalem under Obama, from his role handling Middle East affairs.</p>\n<p>Kushner was non-committal about Ratney, according to two sources familiar with the lobbying. But Kushner did go to bat for Abrams, only to have Trump veto the appointment because Abrams had criticized Trump during the campaign and was opposed by Bannon. Nonetheless, Adelson, who has spoken repeatedly by phone with Kushner, was disappointed with Kushner&#x2019;s inability or unwillingness to deliver on the personnel recommendations, as well as the stasis on the embassy, said three Jewish Republicans active in Israel causes.</p>\n<p>On Abrams, Kushner &#x201C;got outmaneuvered by Bannon and couldn&#x2019;t turn it around,&#x201D; said a leading neoconservative who has spoken to both Kushner and Adelson in recent weeks. The leader added that, despite the attendance of Vice President Mike Pence at this week&#x2019;s conference of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee in Washington, Kushner&#x2019;s absence was noted by attendees, who questioned the administration&#x2019;s Israel policy and Kushner&#x2019;s role in it.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;One of the things that people are realizing now for the first time is that he&#x2019;s in charge of too many things, and therefore his ability to get deeply involved in any one of them is limited,&#x201D; said the neoconservative leader.</p>\n<p>That dynamic was apparent during the debate over the failed health care bill, the Trump administration&#x2019;s first major public policy fight. Kushner privately expressed displeasure with the GOP replacement bill to the president repeatedly and in no uncertain terms, three people familiar with the discussions told POLITICO. He voiced his displeasure so often that Trump at one point grew exasperated, telling his son-in-law that he fully understood his position, according to the two senior administration officials.</p>\n<p>Kushner played a key role in arranging for health expert Zeke Emanuel, an architect of Obamacare, to meet at the White House three times with senior staff and at least once with the president himself to discuss healthcare, according to three people familiar with the visits. Two of the people said the meetings drew eye rolls from conservative Trump staffers, who viewed Emanuel&#x2014;brother of former Obama chief-of-staff Rahm Emanuel&#x2014;as the opposition. (The third Emanuel brother, talent agent Ari, represented Trump during his &#x201C;Apprentice&#x201D; days.)</p>\n<p>Kushner is &#x201C;genuinely interested in trying to find the right answers to solve difficult problems in the country in a bipartisan way,&#x201D; Zeke Emanuel said. &#x201C;Nothing suggests that he is deeply ideological, and unlike many people in Washington, he&#x2019;s not afraid to acknowledge that there are things that he knows and other things he doesn&#x2019;t know that much about.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>But during Emanuel&#x2019;s final White House visit, on the Monday before the implosion of the healthcare bill, Kushner kept walking in and out of the meeting, according to a source who attended. Then, he disappeared for a few days of skiing and ice-cream outings in Aspen, an absence his critics saw as either a protest or a dereliction of a duty.</p>\n<p>It didn&#x2019;t help that a front page spread in The Washington Post unveiling Kushner&#x2019;s new White House Office of American Innovation appeared on the same day that it was revealed that he had acquiesced to a Senate Intelligence Committee request to testify about meetings with the head of a Russian-government-owned development bank. Kushner failed to disclose the meetings to the White House, blindsiding colleagues managing fallout from the Russia-related scandals gripping the young administration.</p>\n<p>He has encouraged allies not to worry about the Russia investigation because he believes it will go nowhere &#x2014; and says the Trump administration will outgrow its early stumbles. But if it doesn&#x2019;t, allies and aides say, one thing is clear: the president will surely find someone else to take the blame. And Kushner will likely be delivering the bad news.<br></p><aside class=\"story-related \">\n    <aside class=\"content-group inline-module-playbook\">\n        <section class=\"speedbump layout-bi\">\n        <div class=\"speedbump-item pos-alpha\">\n            <div class=\"spotlight spotlight--flex\">\n                \n            </div>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"speedbump-item pos-beta\">\n            <div class=\"js-tealium-newsletter\">\n                <div class=\"dari-frame dari-frame-loaded\">\n                            <p class=\"legal-disclaimer\">By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

Jackie Speier, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, said Saturday she is &#x201C;absolutely convinced&#x201D; the White House generated the bizarre scenario that has embroiled committee chair Rep. Devin Nunes -&#x2014; in which he reportedly obtained information from administration officials regarding foreign surveillance of Trump campaign officials, and then presented it to the president.</p> \n<p>&quot;I am absolutely convinced it started in the Oval Office,&apos;&apos; said Speier (D-Calif.) of what she called the resulting &quot;wild goose chase&quot; in the three weeks since President Donald Trump launched an unfounded tweet accusing former President Barack Obama of wiretapping Trump Tower. </p><p class=\"story-continued\">Story Continued Below</p>\n\n  <p> &#x201C;There&#x2019;s no question in my mind that the president, with the aid of his national security adviser staff, came up with some kind of a ruse to try and suggest there was some kind of validity&#x201D; to his accusation, which has been debunked by intelligence officials, Speier said after a town-hall event in which she and former U.S. Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul examined Russia-Trump connections.</p> \n<p>McFaul, in his appearance with Speier at the San Mateo City Hall &#x2014; a standing-room-only event that drew some 200 people inside the council chambers &#x2014; agreed that he had never witnessed such behavior by a House Intelligence Committee chair and that the actions of Nunes, and of Trump and his White House associates, make it even more important to &quot;get to the bottom of this.&quot; </p> \n<p>In an interview with POLITICO, Speier leveled blistering criticism at the intelligence chairman, saying Nunes&apos; apparent desire to play &#x201C;Maxwell Smart&#x201D; &#x2014; a reference to a once-popular bumbling TV detective &#x2014; and to present to Trump information that he received from the White House itself constituted &#x201C;reckless behavior.&#x201D; Saying that he has &#x201C;ruined his career,&#x201D; which is now &#x201C;tainted,&#x2019;&#x2019; Speier said it is no longer enough that he should recuse himself from the investigation.</p> \n<p> &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t believe he can remain on the committee,&#x2019;&#x2019; said Speier, who is the first member of the Intelligence Committee to call for Nunes&apos; removal from the committee itself. </p> \n<p> &#x201C;This wasn&#x2019;t done to him,&#x2019;&#x2019; she said, adding Nunes voluntarily &#x201C;took an action that impeded his credibility.&#x201D;</p> \n<p>Asked what she believes may be driving the Intelligence Committee chair, Speier told POLITICO that the Republican congressman from Tulare, in California&apos;s Central Valley, &#x201C;came here [to Congress] very young, and he is enamored with the klieg lights and being close to the president.&#x201C;</p> \n<p>After Trump fired off the baseless tweet about Obama, she said, &#x201C;the president clicked his fingers and Devin went running over,&#x2019;&#x2019; apparently to assist him in validating his accusation.</p> \n<p>A New York Times story Saturday reported that two White House staffers relayed intelligence information to Nunes that Trump and some of his associates were &quot;incidentally swept up&quot; in foreign surveillance also relayed to American spy agencies. That story came days after Nunes set off a firestorm with what critics like Speier have called &quot;cloak and dagger&quot; activity &#x2014; diverting an Uber ride, heading to the White House, and obtaining classified information about the surveillance, then giving a press conference about it before he even informed fellow committee members. </p> \n<p> Nunes, in interviews, has specifically denied he received intelligence information from White House officials, a statement that Speier said shows the chairman has &quot;been infected with the same virus the president has about lying.&quot; She added: &#x201C;We have a president who makes this a full-time job.&quot;</p> \n<p> Speier, in an April Fools tweet, jabbed at the president &#x2014; who on Saturday alone issued four tweets denouncing the media for focusing on what he has called a &quot;fake news&quot; story related to his links with Russia. </p>\n<p>&quot;I will be introducing a bill next week which will prohibit @POTUS from posting unsupervised tweets,&apos;&apos; she tweeted. Speier later added in a retweet: &quot;Wish I could introduce such a bill. #aprilfools.&quot;</p><div class=\"story-share \">\n        \n    </div>\n\n\n<aside class=\"content-group\">\n    \n</aside>\n                            <div class=\"shifty-wrapper empty-at-large empty-at-extra\">\n                                <div class=\"story-interrupt format-s pos-beta predetermined shifty-content is-masoned\">\n                                    \n    <aside class=\"content-group global-popular\">\n    \n</aside>\n<aside class=\"content-group global-magazine-recent\">\n    \n</aside>\n\n    </div>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </section>\n                </div>\n\n                \n                \n            </article></div>",

Then, the anti-aircraft guns, the armored troop carriers, and a line of flatbed trucks with automatic cannons. Finally, platoon after platoon of soldiers marched onto the scene, lining up before a stern, black-bearded figure watching the parade from a viewing stand&#x2014;their leader, Zahran Alloush.</p>\n<p>It was March 18, 2015, in the rebel-held Eastern Ghouta enclave near Damascus. The display, videotaped for posterity and recruiting, had been staged by the Islam Army, a rebel faction whose commander was the closest thing that this bombed-out pocket of 400,000 people had to a ruler. The 45-year-old Alloush was a firebrand preacher with a record of political violence that some saw as utterly necessary to free his beleaguered district from the siege waged by Syrian President Bashar Assad, but which others considered the hallmark of a sectarian and power-hungry warlord. </p><p class=\"story-continued\">Story Continued Below</p>\n\n <p>&#x201C;Today, the world conspires against us,&#x201D; Alloush roared from the platform, his voice breaking in a pitch of passion and rage. &#x201C;Know that Paradise is found under the swords,&#x201D; he screamed, &#x201C;know that Paradise awaits us!&#x201D;</p>\n<p>It was bravado, but Alloush and his soldiers were not without hope. Though the four-year-old war in the Eastern Ghouta was now a stalemate, a meaningless daily carnage of tit-for-tat shelling and airstrikes, the rebels knew that Assad was running low on loyal troops and money. His army had suffered painful losses against other Islamist rebels in northern Syria and against the so-called Islamic State in the east. There was no sign yet of a weakening in their area near Damascus, but the rebels told themselves that time was on their side. If a day came when Assad lost his iron grip on the capital, no one would be better placed to fill the void than Zahran Alloush. </p><div class=\"story-interrupt pos-omega format-l \">\n    <aside class=\"interrupt-item\">\n<div class=\"story-media\">\n            <figure class=\"media-item type-photo\">\n                <div class=\"fig-graphic \">\n                    <img src=\"http://static.politico.com/dims4/default/266640e/2147483647/resize/1003x%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F5b%2F6b%2F11766d68478ba97983261ca68bad%2Fzahran-alloush-watches-military-parade-2015-screenshot-from-propaganda-video.jpg\" alt=\"Seated on a podium, Zahran Alloush watches Islam Army fighters and vehicles parading through the Eastern Ghouta, 2015. | Source: Rebel Video\"></div>\n                \n                </figure>\n        </div>\n</aside>\n    </div>\n<p>But at that very moment, as he stood bellowing from his podium, Alloush was at the peak of his political power. In the Eastern Ghouta, he hoped to build an Islamist mini-state ruled by sharia law, as a blueprint for how he envisioned a post-Assad Syria. But he was already experiencing the pressures&#x2014;both political and economic&#x2014;that would be the undoing of the Eastern Ghouta rebellion. For all his military might, Alloush had failed to unite the fractious insurgency. It left his position frailer than many knew, and by the end of the year he would be dead, hastening the decline of the Islam Army and dealing a blow to the Eastern Ghouta rebellion from which it would never recover. </p>\n<p>The failure of Zahran Alloush to consolidate power in the Eastern Ghouta and to present a united front against Assad was more a failure of governance than of military strategy. Like other local rebel leaders, Alloush depended on supplies to pass through an elaborate network of tunnels connecting the Eastern Ghouta to the outside world. Ultimately, his skills as an orator, his command of scripture, and even his military power would matter little if he could not master the complexities of the enclave&#x2019;s siege economy. This was precisely what he failed to do. Alloush was starved of resources by the Assad regime and unable to exert unrivaled authority over the smuggling network. His ambitions bogged down in petty disputes over religious doctrine, prestige and money, crippling his leadership months before his death in a missile strike.</p>\n<p>The story of the rise and fall of Zahran Alloush demonstrates the ability of a charismatic and well-funded demagogue to muster an embittered community against a despised dictator, but it also shows how quick the Islamists were to adopt the same violent, autocratic abuses of power that had inspired their rebellion in the first place. Based on interviews with rebel commanders, religious leaders and civilian activists in the Eastern Ghouta, this account explains how a once-impenetrable stronghold of the Syrian opposition has slowly succumbed to the stranglehold of a brutal regime&#x2014;and how its fate hinged on the life of one man. </p>\n<p><b> &#x2018;The fairest place on earth&#x2019;</b></p>\n<p>The 14th-century Arab historian Ibn al-Wardi spoke of the Ghouta as an exquisite oasis of flowers, trees, water and bird life&#x2014;&#x201C;the fairest place on earth, and the best of them.&#x201D; A lush agricultural belt around Damascus, it had been the pride of the ancient city for thousands of years. But modern Syria was less kind to the Ghouta. In the 1990s and 2000s, its pastoral beauty was swallowed up by drab concrete slums, asphalt roads and industrial expansion, slowly reducing the Ghouta to an unhappy agglomeration of working-class suburbs, satellite towns and farming villages.</p>\n<p>Many inhabitants of the Ghouta and the bulging suburbs of eastern Damascus were new arrivals, escaping from drought-stricken parts of Syria to compete over low-paying, menial jobs. They bristled at the glittering wealth, the class divides and the corruption of the capital. Others were part of the Ghouta&#x2019;s original population, but among them, too, anti-regime sentiment grew alongside the social crisis of the early 2000s. In conservative Sunni towns like Douma, known for its piety as &#x201C;the city of minarets,&#x201D; the Sunni-fundamentalist teachings of Salafism were gaining ground. The Salafists excoriated the secularism of the ruling Baath Party and its rapacious corruption as two sides of the same coin.</p>\n<p>This was the environment of simmering anger in which Zahran Alloush grew up. Born in 1971 to a Saudi-trained Syrian Salafi scholar who preached in Douma&#x2019;s Tawhid Mosque, Alloush spent the 1990s at the Islamic University in Medina, learning at the feet of famous Wahhabi scholars like Ibn Baz and Ibn Othaymeen, the men whose ultraconservative worldview had shaped the politics of Saudi Arabia.</p>\n<p>Later in the 1990s, Alloush returned to Douma to continue his studies at the Sharia Faculty of Damascus University. He then went into business, marrying and living what outwardly seemed like the quiet life of a devout Muslim family man. Behind the scenes, however, he ran an underground Salafi network, organizing illegal study groups and printing and distributing religious tracts by Saudi ideologues, some of whom secretly funded his work. In Alloush&#x2019;s understanding of Islam, a strictly sharia-based Sunni theocracy was the only legitimate system of government, and the Baathist regime would one day have to be swept away. He loathed the dictatorial rule and corruption of the Assad family, hated their alliance with the Shia leaders of Iran, and, like most Salafis, he viewed the president&#x2019;s Alawite faith as an anti-Islamic heresy.</p>\n<p>Yet, Alloush was not part of the militant Salafi-jihadi movement, which had begun to infiltrate Syria as a consequence of the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq. He seems to have considered Al Qaeda a misguided though possibly well-intentioned group, opposing its adventurist policies and its attacks on countries like Saudi Arabia. But like the vast majority of Syrians, he sympathized with the Sunni resistance in Iraq, of which Al Qaeda was a prominent part, and though it seems he never crossed the border to join the Iraqi rebels, he may have provided support for them in other ways.</p><div class=\"story-interrupt pos-alpha format-m \">\n    <aside class=\"interrupt-item\">\n<div class=\"story-media\">\n            <figure class=\"media-item type-photo\">\n                <div class=\"fig-graphic \">\n                    <img src=\"http://static.politico.com/dims4/default/b008652/2147483647/resize/658x%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F92%2Ff6%2F89a91ecc4f6c99a1466d0881371b%2Fgettyimages-546969982.jpg\" alt=\"Smokes billows after a strike by pro-Syrian government forces in Shefounieh, near Douma, a rebel-held town east of the capital Damascus, on July 13, 2016. | Getty\"></div>\n                \n                </figure>\n        </div>\n</aside>\n    </div>\n<p>Around 2008, Assad&#x2019;s secret police initiated a country-wide crackdown on Sunni fundamentalists, partly in response to U.S. pressure but also because the regime was growing concerned with the rising Salafi radicalism. Alloush was arrested in 2009 and charged with gun possession, though the main reason for his arrest seems to have been his Salafi activism. He was sent to Seidnaya Prison, north of Damascus, and would remain there for two years, rubbing shoulders with Iraq War veterans and learning the insurgent tactics they had used to bog down the Americans since 2003.</p>\n<p><b>The Syrian Uprising</b></p>\n<p>It was the Arab Spring that freed him. In March 2011, demonstrations erupted in several areas of Syria, including Douma. The regime arrested and shot at demonstrators, and the country tumbled toward civil war. Whether as a concession to the opposition or as a way of poisoning it with sectarian extremism, Assad quickly began to release political prisoners in a series of amnesties, including hundreds of violent jihadists. Alloush was freed after one such amnesty, on June 22, and he arrived home just in time to join the budding rebellion in Douma.</p>\n<p>At first, he joined a local band of fighters claiming to be part of the Free Syrian Army&#x2014;a brand name of sorts, used by many different groups&#x2014;but it was not sufficiently religious for his tastes. Soon, Alloush had created his own group, known as the Islam Company, which drew on Douma&#x2019;s pre-war network of Salafi activists, Islamist ex-prisoners, and friends and students of his father at the Tawhid Mosque. </p>\n<p>The Islam Company quickly established itself as a force to be reckoned with. Its pious image and reputation for religious incorruptibility formed part of the appeal. The Salafis&#x2019; discipline was a great asset in Syria&#x2019;s chaotic insurgency, while Alloush&#x2019;s zeal and charisma drew recruits and energized the troops. Alloush&#x2019;s deep pockets also played a part. Gulf-based Salafi preachers like Adnan al-Arour, a Syrian televangelist-in-exile and old acquaintance of the Alloush family from Saudi Arabia, collected huge sums in donations from the faithful. By offering strong leadership, religious legitimacy and a regular salary, Alloush was able to poach members from the smaller Free Syrian Army factions in Douma, which were often no more than poorly organized local gangs. By 2013, the group had expanded from Douma to the wider Eastern Ghouta region and was even spawning affiliates in northern Syria. To mark its growing power, Alloush renamed it the Islam Brigade.</p>\n<p>In late 2012, the Syrian regime decided to cut its losses by cordoning off the Eastern Ghouta instead of trying to retake it. In April 2013, Assad sent an armored column to Oteiba, a desert town on the eastern fringes of the area<b> </b>that had served as a way station for supplies trickling in from Turkey. &#x201C;The battle of Oteiba was a tipping point between success and disaster,&#x201D; a member of a local rebel faction later recalled, pointing to its crucial role in supplying the insurgency. &#x201C;It was not the only such place,&#x201D; he said, &#x201C;but it was the last one.&#x201D;</p><div class=\"story-interrupt pos-omega format-l \">\n    <aside class=\"interrupt-item\">\n<div class=\"story-media\">\n            <figure class=\"media-item type-photo\">\n                <div class=\"fig-graphic \">\n                    <img src=\"http://static.politico.com/dims4/default/c110b57/2147483647/resize/1003x%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F83%2F95%2Fb5169a7b4672a7159aedded946ab%2Fgettyimages-451869043.jpg\" alt=\"A rebel fighter holds a position in a damaged building in the northeastern Syrian city of Deir Ezzor on November 24, 2013. | Getty\"></div>\n                \n                </figure>\n        </div>\n</aside>\n    </div>\n<p>The rebels were trapped. Despite months of fighting, they could not break the siege. Soon, they were bogged down in heavy fighting in the suburbs of eastern Damascus, where they suffered relentless airstrikes and even chemical attacks, culminating in an August 21 massacre with nerve-gas tipped missiles that killed hundreds and nearly drew the United States into the war. Assad&#x2019;s plan worked. Though rebel mortars still made life unsafe in Damascus and fighting flared along the front line, the Eastern Ghouta insurgency had been fully contained by late summer 2013. Paradoxically, however, the siege also helped bring the rebels together by delineating the boundaries of the local insurgency.</p>\n<p>In autumn 2013, money poured into the Eastern Ghouta from Salafi preachers in Kuwait, whose regular fundraising telethons brought in millions of dollars for the Syrian opposition. Much of that money seems to have ended up with Alloush, whose religious views dovetailed with those of the Kuwaiti funders and whose large and well-run faction seemed a natural choice to lead the enclave. The Saudi royal family, or at least a faction of it, also appears to have thrown its considerable weight behind Alloush around this time. Prince Bandar bin Sultan, then the head of Saudi Arabia&#x2019;s General Intelligence, is said to have reacted angrily to the U.S. refusal to order airstrikes after the August 21 massacre. The Saudis reportedly decided to overlook Alloush&#x2019;s ties to dissident Salafi clerics on bad terms with the government in Riyadh, and began to rush support to his group and many other Syrian rebels as a way of raising pressure on Assad.</p>\n<p>Flush with cash and arms, Alloush went on a buying spree. All through autumn and winter, he ushered dozens of smaller factions into his organization, which renamed itself the Islam Army at a grand ceremony in October 2013. Now indisputably the alpha rebel of the Eastern Ghouta, he would soon discover that with rising power came growing resistance.</p>\n<p><b>Strongman Rule </b></p>\n<p>At 10:40 p.m. on December 9, 2013, armed men broke into a Douma office housing several civil society organizations and abducted Razan Zeitouneh, Wael Hammadeh, Samira al-Khalil and Nazem Hammadi. The Douma Four, as they would become known, were prominent human-rights activists on the secular fringe of Syrian opposition politics. In 2011, they had fled Damascus and found shelter in rebel-held Douma, where their group, the Violations Documentation Center, began to create a database listing tens of thousands of dead and disappeared Syrians, most of them victims of Assad&#x2019;s army and secret police. This common foe would appear to make them natural allies of Alloush, but it was quite the opposite. Alloush<b> </b>disapproved of their calls for secular democracy, their contacts with Western governments and their friendly ties to a rival rebel group that opposed the Islam Army and its Salafi preachers. He denied involvement in the kidnappings, but the Douma Four would become a potent symbol of his authoritarian ways, and it was far from the only incident of its kind.</p>\n<p>Since 2012, when the rebels took control of the Eastern Ghouta and expelled Assad&#x2019;s regime, they had struggled to install a proper government to fill the political void. Rival commanders set up their own sharia courts and revolutionary tribunals, but these only spurred new conflicts. The imposition of the siege in April 2013 made things worse by empowering smugglers and organized crime, and by feeding the opposition&#x2019;s well-founded fear of infiltration. Soon, rebels were spying on each other and paying informers to tell on their neighbors, effectively copying the police-state tactics of the regime they sought to overthrow.<b> </b>Though other factions committed egregious abuses, too, the Islam Army gained an especially chilling reputation. By 2014, terrifying reports had begun to trickle out from the Repentance Prison in Douma, a secret jail where opponents of the Islam Army were tortured and killed on the orders of the group&#x2019;s religious tribunals.</p><div class=\"story-interrupt pos-alpha format-m \">\n    <aside class=\"interrupt-item\">\n<div class=\"story-media\">\n            <figure class=\"media-item type-photo\">\n                <div class=\"fig-graphic \">\n                    <img src=\"http://static.politico.com/dims4/default/f9a8fa3/2147483647/resize/658x%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Ff6%2F87%2Fd24e7b954c70b514526de058d357%2Fgettyimages-468137688.jpg\" alt=\"Zahran Alloush (C) delivers a speech during a meeting in the eastern Ghouta region of the capital of Syria, Damascus, on March 30, 2015. | Getty\"></div>\n                \n                </figure>\n        </div>\n</aside>\n    </div>\n<p>Despite this brutality, Zahran Alloush seems to have maintained a solid base of support. His fundamentalist views shocked Western observers and secular Syrians, but they did not seem to offend conservative Sunni Muslims in the Eastern Ghouta. His repression of dissent and the growing evidence of financial corruption inside Islam Army ranks were dismissed by his supporters. Other factions were no better, only less successful, they argued, and harsh tactics were needed to end crime and anarchy. Many seem to have reasoned that only a strongman like Alloush could unite the enclave and harness the full potential of the perpetually divided insurgency against Assad.</p>\n<p>Indeed, for the first time in years, unity seemed within reach. In late June 2014, most of the Eastern Ghouta&#x2019;s sharia courts merged into a single structure, led by a panel of Islamic scholars appointed by the major rebel factions. In late August, this was followed by the creation of the Unified Military Command, a politico-military body over which Zahran Alloush presided as supreme commander, flanked by the leaders of the Eastern Ghouta&#x2019;s second- and third-ranking factions: Ajnad al-Sham, a Muslim Brotherhood-friendly network of Sufis, and the Free Syrian Army-flagged Failaq al-Rahman. For the first time since the expulsion of the Baath regime, the Eastern Ghouta was beginning to create a cohesive legal and political system. It was no small matter. All over Syria, rebels had tried to establish similar judicial and military councils, but nearly all of these experiments in local governance had failed since participants always had the option to simply walk away from a ruling they did not like. In the Eastern Ghouta, that wasn&#x2019;t possible. The siege had created a self-contained political universe that was big enough to be a threat to the Syrian government, but also small enough to be dominated by a single strongman: Zahran Alloush. Though he paid little heed to the Unified Military Command when the other members tried to restrain him, he was fond of using the system to deflect responsibility for unpopular actions, and he jealously guarded its primacy.</p>\n<p>Not all factions in the Eastern Ghouta had joined the new institutions. The Al Qaeda-aligned Nusra Front refused to dissolve its own sharia tribunals, citing doctrinal differences. But the main challenge came from a group of Free Syrian Army commanders, old enemies of Alloush from Douma, who banded together in an opportunistic alliance to oppose the new order and protect their autonomy. Outraged, Alloush announced that there could not be &#x201C;two heads on the same body&#x201D; and launched a major crackdown, later admitting to rounding up some 1,300 of his opponents. Most were eventually released, but not all. Abu Ali Khibbiyeh, a prominent anti-Islamist leader who had been fighting to keep Alloush off his turf and out of his smuggling business, was convicted in a secret tribunal of trading in narcotics, collaborating with the Islamic State and the Assad regime, and being a homosexual. Opposition sources later claimed that Khibbiyeh&#x2019;s corpse had been paraded through the streets of Douma on a pickup truck, as a warning to would-be challengers.</p>\n<p>Through winter and spring 2014&#x2013;15,<b> </b>Alloush proceeded to root out the Eastern Ghouta wing of the Islamic State, while press-ganging a series of small rebel groups into the ranks of the Islam Army, already several thousand strong. In February 2015, the Unified Military Command decreed a ban on the creation of new rebel groups in the Eastern Ghouta, which put a lid on rebel fragmentation and helped the insurgency to congeal around its four main factions: the Islam Army, Ajnad al-Sham, Failaq al-Rahman, and the rogue jihadis of the Nusra Front. </p>\n<p>The consolidation of opposition forces came at an opportune time. Assad&#x2019;s forces were exhausted by years of fighting and economic trouble, and since late 2014 they had been losing territory in other parts of the country. But the rebels in the Eastern Ghouta found themselves unable to take advantage of the regime&#x2019;s predicament: Prisoners in their enclave, they struggled to cope with the mounting costs of the siege.</p>\n<p><b>The Siege Economy</b></p>\n<p>First imposed through the Syrian army&#x2019;s retaking of Oteiba in April 2013, the siege on the Eastern Ghouta had been tightened a year later to include a blockade on food, medicine and other imports. Prices of basic goods rose sharply through 2014. In March 2015, a bag of flat bread, which is a staple food in Syria, could be bought for the state-regulated price of 35 Syrian pounds in Damascus (about 12 cents) but reportedly sold for close to 700 Syrian pounds in the Eastern Ghouta. Hunger spread, and at times starvation was near, but it was the shortage of medicines and hospital equipment that seemed the most lethal threat. The pro-opposition Syrian American Medical Society counted some 200 deaths due to the lack of medical care or food in the first two years of the siege, and Amnesty International labeled the Syrian government&#x2019;s policies toward the Eastern Ghouta a crime against humanity.</p>\n<p>Though it was at times very harshly enforced, the blockade on the Eastern Ghouta was never airtight. It sometimes seemed designed to be leaky, and while always strict enough to cause shortages, it was also porous enough to create markets where shrewd middlemen could thrive. Much like in the Gaza Strip, the blockade served to empower a new class of siege-busting smugglers who found ways to move goods across the front lines, often by working with regime commanders. Rebels and smugglers entered into a symbiotic relationship, incentivizing corruption and competition among the insurgents&#x2014;a threat to your smuggling profits was also a threat to your military posture.</p>\n<p>The Syrian regime eagerly exploited its newfound leverage. It would sometimes choke off the enclave entirely, which sent prices skyrocketing. Then it would allow deliveries through a particular checkpoint, either to reward behavior or simply to collect bribes. On their side of the checkpoints, the rebel leaders jockeyed for control and were drawn into murky deals with their counterparts on the regime side and with each other, which slowly fused the insurgency and the siege economy into an inseparable whole. It was demoralizing, and it did much to fuel tension in the enclave. War-weary and hungry civilians bristled at the sight of ostentatiously pious Islamist leaders who hoarded food, money and fuel for their own use&#x2014;and, in some cases, for profit.</p>\n<p>The most important of the Eastern Ghouta&#x2019;s new trade routes was the no-man&#x2019;s-land northeast of Douma, near the regime-held Wafideen camp for Palestine refugees. At some point in 2014, the Syrian government had opened a checkpoint there to allow a Ghouta-born businessman with friends in the presidential palace to bring in food, alongside a small-scale trade in other goods. Run by the Syrian military on one side and by rebels on the other, the Wafideen Crossing became known in Damascus as the &#x201C;million pound checkpoint&#x201D; in reference to the bribes collected by commanders on both sides.</p>\n<p>Though the Islam Army jealously guarded its control over the crossing, it denied making any money off of the Wafideen-Douma trade. &#x201C;The role of the Islam Army in all of this is simply to provide security, so that agents of the regime do not infiltrate via the crossing,&#x201D; said Mohammed Bayraqdar, a member of the Islam Army&#x2019;s political office. But rival commanders insisted that Alloush&#x2019;s men profited handsomely, with one activist claiming in spring 2015 the Islam Army was taking a 30-percent commission on each shipment. For all its economic and political importance, however, the Wafideen Crossing mainly brought in food and other civilian items, like cigarettes. To get hold of guns, ammunition, fuel, medicine and other banned or undersupplied goods, and to smuggle people in or out of the enclave, the rebels had to find other ways.</p>\n<p>They went underground.</p><div class=\"story-interrupt pos-alpha format-m \">\n    <aside class=\"interrupt-item\">\n<div class=\"story-media\">\n            <figure class=\"media-item type-photo\">\n                <div class=\"fig-graphic \">\n                    <img src=\"http://static.politico.com/dims4/default/5aef2c5/2147483647/resize/658x%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Ffb%2Fd6%2Fbbfa234446ff986d0ba2bdde03b9%2Fgettyimages-501778884.jpg\" alt=\"Rebel fighters, reportedly belonging to the Faylaq al-Rahman brigade, wait in a concrete pipe during an operation in the area of Marj al-Sultan&apos;s military airport, three days after it was recaptured by the Syrian troops, on December 17, 2015 in the rebel-held region of Eastern Ghouta, on the outskirts of the Syrian capital Damascus. | Getty\"></div>\n                \n                </figure>\n        </div>\n</aside>\n    </div>\n<p>In early 2014, the Syrian army had forced the eastern Damascus suburbs of Barzeh and Qaboun to sign separate truce deals. Local fighters remained in charge of their neighborhoods, and both areas remained under siege, but civilian traffic and trade resumed through a maze of regime and rebel checkpoints. Almost immediately, Barzeh and Qaboun transformed into transit depots for the Eastern Ghouta by way of tunnels reaching into the rebel-controlled suburbs. Rebel-connected entrepreneurs turned the tunnels&#x2014;originally dug for military and logistical purposes&#x2014;into a business, hiring unemployed local men to do the dangerous underground work. Most tunnels were crudely carved dirt corridors barely one-man wide, but some were professionally constructed subterranean roads, large enough to drive a car under the front line.</p>\n<p>The most important of these tunnels passed between Barzeh and Harasta, a working-class suburb on the western edge of the Eastern Ghouta. Apparently untouched by the army, the tunnel operated around the clock in triple shifts, moving everything from food and people to medicine and livestock, and also, almost certainly, weapons and ammunition.</p>\n<p>The man in charge of the tunnel was Abu Khaled al-Zahteh, a local boy from Harasta who had wriggled his way up through rebel ranks to become the ruler of his neighborhood. A man of uncertain ideology but evident ambition, Abu Khaled at one point ran a minor Free Syrian Army faction backed by the Muslim Brotherhood, but in 2014 he entered into a complicated on-off relationship with Ajnad al-Sham, a much larger group of conservative Sufi militants. He seized Harasta in the winter of 2014&#x2013;15, initially by aligning himself with Alloush to grab the tunnel from one of his rivals, and then by using his newfound economic power to buy off competitors. Once in charge of the Harasta-Barzeh route, Abu Khaled began to extort other commanders who depended on the trade for their supplies; they tried to compensate by opening rival smuggling tunnels from nearby neighborhoods.</p>\n<p>By summer 2015, the Eastern Ghouta was trapped in a vicious circle of competitive smuggling, profiteering and pricing disputes. Though the Islam Army ran its own tunnels, it was left with too thin a slice of the trade to support its hopes for hegemony, and a frustrated Alloush began to flex his military muscles.</p>\n<p><b>When Money Ran Out</b></p>\n<p>As he sat glumly on his podium in March 2015 watching the soldiers and tanks of the Islam Army file past him, Zahran Alloush resembled nothing so much as a traditional Arab president. His armed following was said to account for more than half of the enclave&#x2019;s total military power, and he had become one of the most powerful men in the Syrian opposition. But Alloush knew that to finally subdue internal resistance and unify the enclave, he first had to gain control over the tunnel economy that propped up his rivals. Others knew it, too.</p>\n<p>In early 2015, the Syrian military bombed Alloush&#x2019;s tunnels, disrupting the trade and increasing the Islam Army&#x2019;s dependence on Abu Khaled al-Zahteh. Foreign support also seems to have tapered off, partly because of U.S. pressure on the Gulf Arab states to rein in Islamist fundraisers, some of whom had been sponsoring Al Qaeda and the Islamic State. According to reports in the Arabic press, Alloush was eventually forced to borrow money from local merchants to make ends meet.</p>\n<p>In May 2015, the Islam Army leader had himself smuggled out of the enclave to go on a panhandling trip through Turkey and Jordan, where he met with Islamist benefactors and officials from Turkey and Saudi Arabia. Scrambling to clean up his image, Alloush also gave his first-ever interview to a Western reporter, insisting that his calls to cleanse Syria from Alawites and Shia Muslims had been the result of &#x201C;psychological stress.&#x201D; He may have met with U.S. officials, too, but, if so, he failed to make an impression. Members of the Islam Army later claimed that the Americans had aired a laundry list of what they considered unacceptable behavior, including the shelling of central Damascus, Alloush&#x2019;s sectarian rhetoric and his alleged role in the disappearance of the Douma Four.<b> </b>Though his round trip did seem to bring in fresh donations from the Gulf or other sources, it could not offset his dependence on Abu Khaled&#x2019;s smuggling business.</p>\n<p>Safely back in the enclave, Alloush decided to make a move on the tunnels. &#x201C;The Islam Army leadership began erecting earth berms around the town of Harasta and they banned people from entering or exiting,&#x201D; recalled a supporter of Abu Khaled al-Zahteh. That summer, Alloush ordered tanks to the outskirts of Harasta, but, with impeccable timing, Abu Khaled had just rediscovered his interest in religion and was accepted back into the ranks of Ajnad al-Sham, which told Alloush to back off. The Islam Army leader was furious, but he could do nothing unless he wanted to trigger a major battle with several factions at once. He withdrew the tanks. But with the Islam Army&#x2019;s logistical needs still unmet and its appetite for power unsatisfied, the status quo was unsustainable. In an enclave now teeming with distrust and accumulated ill will, all sides began to prepare for the coming confrontation.</p>\n<p>To the population of the Eastern Ghouta, the bickering rebel leaders looked like vultures feeding from a carcass. They were incapable of breaking the siege, but in the eyes of local activists they didn&#x2019;t even seem to be trying, instead squandering their resources on venal feuds over the tunnel trade. A 2015 study by the London School of Economics found &#x201C;widespread resentment&#x201D; against the insurgent commanders, even among solidly anti-Assad respondents. All the while, Assad kept up a relentless drumbeat of airstrikes against the Eastern Ghouta, killing hundreds of civilians and creating an intolerable state of paranoid suspense and terror.</p>\n<p>That summer, the enclave was rocked by street protests of hungry civilians, who accused the rebels of profiteering and of seizing food for themselves. Graffiti appeared on the walls of Harasta calling Abu Khaled &#x201C;a murderer of children through hunger.&#x201D; As the Unified Military Command&#x2019;s supreme commander and by far the most powerful figure in the Eastern Ghouta, Zahran Alloush took the brunt of the criticism&#x2014;including for the greed and graft of the tunnel trade, in which he held a much smaller stake than some of his rivals. &#x201C;Hey Zahran,&#x201D; read a placard carried by protesters in August 2015, &#x201C;we don&#x2019;t want you to fight your brothers over a tunnel, we want you to fight our enemy above the tunnel!&#x201D; Intra-rebel conflict bled into the civilian outrage as all factions incited their own followers to demonstrate against rival groups and blame them for civilian hunger. In response to the protests, rebel fighters kicked downs doors and arrested troublemakers, and on at least one occasion, troops from Failaq al-Rahman fired into the crowds, wounding and killing demonstrators.</p>\n<p>The power-sharing arrangements created a year earlier now began to crumble, threatening Alloush&#x2019;s achievements. In late summer, Ajnad al-Sham and Failaq al-Rahman decided to boycott meetings of the Unified Military Command, arguing that the Islam Army was merely using it as cover to pursue its own political and financial interests. Alloush reacted as if he had been betrayed. At a gathering of Ghouta notables in a bunker-like basement a few days later, a leaked video recording showed the Islam Army leader hurling accusations at his rivals, a streak of unhinged desperation creeping into his voice. The leaders of Ajnad al-Sham and Failaq al-Rahman were profiting from starvation, he screamed, and the criminal Abu Khaled had hoarded a thousand tons of food in his Harasta warehouses. They were the exact same charges that his rivals had leveled at him.</p>\n<p>Things went from bad to worse in September 2015, when Russia suddenly threw its military might behind Assad, sending its own air force and vast amounts of military equipment to aid his beleaguered regime. The government went back on the offensive all over Syria, including in the Eastern Ghouta. As bombs rained down over the enclave, killing hundreds of insurgents and civilians, local activists called out for unity and a counterattack. Instead, they got another fight over tunnel profits&#x2014;now involving the Nusra Front, which had decided to sell food at cut-rate prices, thus threatening the financial base of its rivals.</p><div class=\"story-interrupt pos-alpha format-m \">\n    <aside class=\"interrupt-item\">\n<div class=\"story-media\">\n            <figure class=\"media-item type-photo\">\n                <div class=\"fig-graphic \">\n                    <img src=\"http://static.politico.com/dims4/default/8435af4/2147483647/resize/658x%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F39%2F5d%2Fe222b2cc4e1f998d05f04bfd8f5b%2Falloush-dead.jpeg\" alt=\"Zahran Alloush who was killed on December 25, 2015.\"></div>\n                \n                </figure>\n        </div>\n</aside>\n    </div>\n<p>And then, the central pillar of the enclave&#x2019;s political order suddenly snapped. On Christmas Day, 2015, a volley of missiles slammed into a nondescript farm building near Hammouriyeh in the Eastern Ghouta. Later that day, the Islam Army solemnly announced the martyrdom of Zahran Alloush. The strongman of the Eastern Ghouta was gone.</p>\n<p><b>A Power Vacuum</b></p>\n<p>By the time of Zahran Alloush&#x2019;s death, the window of opportunity for unity in the Eastern Ghouta was already closing. Now it slammed shut. Syria&#x2019;s fragmented insurgency had always been too divided by personal ambition, political and religious doctrine, and foreign connections to unite spontaneously from the bottom up. The Eastern Ghouta was no different. But the start of the siege in 2013 and the consequent rise of Zahran Alloush had changed the game. His charisma, leadership skills and powerful backers, combined with an unswerving dedication to the war against Assad and a seemingly boundless thirst for power, briefly seemed to set the Eastern Ghouta on a path to centralized control. But Alloush, too, found himself bogged down in the siege economy, unable to suppress his rivals and end the centrifugal tendencies of the rebellion. Once this controversial and contested but undisputedly central figure was lost, the Eastern Ghouta&#x2019;s rival groups quickly spun off in their own directions.</p>\n<p>Although the Islam Army quickly handed power to a new leader&#x2014;a stocky, muscular veteran of Douma&#x2019;s Salafi underground named Essam Boueidani&#x2014;he had trouble filling Alloush&#x2019;s shoes. Religious hard-liners began to drift out of control, roaring threats toward other groups. &#x201C;We had some minor problems with Zahran Alloush when he was alive, but thanks to his charisma, he was mostly able to maintain discipline in the Islam Army,&#x201D; recalled Wael Olwan, then a leader and spokesperson for Ajnad al-Sham. &#x201C;That has changed now. We didn&#x2019;t see this aggressive rhetoric from the religious officials of the Islam Army while he was alive, but now we do.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Olwan&#x2019;s own group was not innocent of what would happen. The lesser commanders of the Eastern Ghouta all aspired to Alloush&#x2019;s mantle, and in February 2016, Ajnad al-Sham merged into Failaq al-Rahman, positioning the group as a main rival of the Islam Army. Some weeks later, the one-time Sufi moderate Abu Khaled al-Zahteh decided that he was now a jihadist and brought his Harasta brigade into an alliance with the Nusra Front. In a matter of weeks, the factional landscape of the Eastern Ghouta had been whittled down to three big groups, two of which plotted their revenge on the third.</p>\n<p>The Islam Army lashed out to protect its position, and in March 2016, Failaq al-Rahman accused it of trying to assassinate its leaders. This set in motion a spiral of tit-for-tat violence that escalated into a civil war within the civil war. </p>\n<p>In a surprise attack on April 28, Failaq al-Rahman and its allies robbed the Islam Army of its two main smuggling tunnels in the Damascus suburbs and of large stockpiles of weapons; the group would never recover from the blow. Internecine violence raged for weeks, during which Assad retook the southern part of the enclave and threatened to march deep into the Eastern Ghouta. A rebel cease-fire was brokered by Qatar on May 24, but, although major infighting stopped, the two camps refused to reconcile. &#x201C;We now have two military councils, one belonging to Failaq al-Rahman and one belonging to the Islam Army. We have some educational institutions belonging to Failaq al-Rahman and others that belong to the Islam Army, and the provincial authorities &#x2026; have also split into two parts,&#x201D; complained a local activist. </p>\n<p>Indeed, the enclave was now two enclaves, and the Syrian regime cleverly exploited the new situation by focusing its firepower solely on the Islam Army-controlled eastern end of the Ghouta, while allowing U.N. aid to reach the Failaq al-Rahman-held suburbs of Damascus for the first time in years. Just as it calculated, no rebel reinforcements found their way across the divided enclave before it was too late. Town by town and field by field, the opposition&#x2019;s hold on the Eastern Ghouta began to slip.</p>\n<p>A year after Zahran Alloush&#x2019;s death, the rebels are still fighting, but nearly half the territory of the enclave has been lost. In Harasta, Abu Khaled&#x2019;s men have tried to negotiate the terms of a surrender with the government, and similar talks have taken place in Douma, quietly overseen by the Islam Army. In February 2017, Assad raised the stakes by launching an offensive on Qaboun and Barzeh, attempting to plug the tunnels and finally strangle the insurgency. The rebels put on a brave face in interviews conducted earlier this year. &#x201C;God willing, if the regime makes such a stupid move, it will come to greatly regret it,&#x201D; said Saeed Darwish, a high-ranking Islam Army leader. &#x201C;They will not succeed in this plan,&#x201D; insisted a civilian activist. &#x201C;We will persevere in our land, and we will not leave it except as conquerors going to Damascus,&#x201D; said another.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the attacks on Qaboun and Barzeh touched off a violent rebel counteroffensive against eastern Damascus, and fighting still rages in late March. But it is unlikely to save the rebellion.</p>\n<p>The time has long since passed when the insurgents of the Eastern Ghouta could unite in the face of Assad&#x2019;s superior firepower, never mind turn the war around to threaten his hold on power. Two years after the day when Zahran Alloush watched his forces march past the viewing stand, the once-fearsome Islam Army is struggling for survival, the Eastern Ghouta gasps for air, and the Syrian opposition is trapped in a spiral of disintegration and defeat.</p><div class=\"story-share \">\n        \n    </div>\n<div class=\"story-supplement\">\n                                            <footer class=\"content-notes magazine-notes\">\n                                                <p><i>Aron Lund is a Swedish journalist and a fellow with the New York-based Century Foundation, which recently published his report </i><a href=\"https://tcf.org/content/report/into-the-tunnels/\">Into the Tunnels</a><i>.

It was a trash pickup day, Galvin said, explaining the postal carrier has since&#xA0;told him he was concerned the packages would be mistaken for trash and end up in the garbage truck as the reason he walked toward the house.</p><p>The postal carrier was walking&#xA0;down the driveway&#xA0;toward the home when&#xA0;Gabbana&#xA0;ran out of the garage and toward him, Galvin said. Somehow the dog bit the tip of the carrier&apos;s finger, Galvin said. The dog, his owner said, was most likely going for the packages and grabbed the finger instead.</p><p>U.S.&#xA0;Postal Service&#xA0;Spokesman&#xA0;George&#xA0;&#xA0;Flood said&#xA0;the mail carrier involved&#xA0;was not available to be reached for comment.</p><p>&quot;The UPS and Fed Ex drivers&#xA0;also don&apos;t come all the way up the driveway,&quot;&#xA0;Galvin&#xA0;said. &quot;They&#xA0;leave&#xA0;the package and they carry dog treats.&quot;</p><p>Once when&#xA0;Gabanna&#xA0;wasn&apos;t wearing his shock collar, he&#xA0;ran and sat in the Federal Express truck, he said, not hurting anyone.</p><p>Galvin&apos;s attorney John McDermott,&#xA0; said&#xA0;he was able to reach an agreement with&#xA0;Wantage&#xA0;Prosecutor&#xA0;William Haggerty&#xA0;to change the classification from vicious to dangerous, which would save&#xA0;Gabanna&apos;s&#xA0;life. He said the postal carrier also expressed that he does not want the dog euthanized. The only thing standing in the way of the changed classification, McDermott said, is&#xA0;Vernon Township&apos;s&#xA0;animal&#xA0;control&#xA0;officer,&#xA0;Thomas&#xA0;Maellaro.</p><p>The dog was initially to be quarantined for 10 days but&#xA0;Maellaro, according to McDermott and Galvin, would not release Gabbana to the family.&#xA0;After three months in the Vernon animal shelter,&#xA0;Galvin&#xA0;said the animal control officer released&#xA0;the dog&#xA0;under the supervision of the&#xA0;Franklin&#xA0;Pet Spa. Gabbana is not allowed contact with any other dogs or people other than the&#xA0;Galvins&#xA0;and staff at the spa.</p><p>Marianne&#xA0;Sykes, a certified dog trainer and general manager at the spa,&#xA0;said she&#xA0;evaluated Gabbana and&#xA0;said she did not find him&#xA0;to be vicious.</p><p>&quot;I pulled his ears,&#xA0;his tail...stuck my hand in his mouth,&quot;&#xA0;and nothing happened,&#xA0;Sykes said. The trainer said she was able to get the dog to submit by rolling on his back, adding&#xA0;Gabbana could be home with his family.</p><p>McDermott said&#xA0;the next step is for Gabbana&apos;s case to be appealed to the Sussex County Superior Court. He is waiting for the transcripts from the&#xA0;Wantage&#xA0;court before he can file the paper work.&#xA0;McDermott and Galvin asked for the case to be heard in Wantage rather than Vernon.</p><p>The attorney said&#xA0;the chances of&#xA0;winning on appeal are good.&#xA0;McDermott said&#xA0;Vernon police and the&#xA0;animal control officers&#xA0;entered&#xA0;Galvin&apos;s property to get the dog without warrant circumventing their right to due process.&#xA0;He also&#xA0;said the court didn&apos;t allow the&#xA0;Galvins&#xA0;to enter Sykes&apos;&#xA0;evaluation into the record.</p><p>Galvin said he hopes the&#xA0;case&#xA0;will&#xA0;be settled before it gets to court. He is willing to declare Gabbana a dangerous dog, which would&#xA0;require a dangerous dog/no trespassing&#xA0;sign,&#xA0;an invisible fence,&#xA0;a fenced in kennel&#xA0;to be installed and&#xA0;tattoo warning people that his dog is consider dangerous.</p><p>&quot;We just want him home,&quot;&#xA0;Galvin&#xA0;said. He said his legal bills, so far, are at&#xA0;$10,000.</p><p>Maellaro&#xA0;did not return calls or emails seeking information.</p><p>When reached,&#xA0;Haggert&#xA0;said he had no comment.</p><p class=\"article-print-url\">Read or Share this story: https://njersy.co/2nJt2Hl</p></div><aside class=\"story-right-rail\"><section id=\"module-position-P2B_HQKtoCs\" class=\"storyrightrail-bucket poster-ad-asset-module story-poster-ad-asset-module\"></section><section id=\"module-position-P2B_HQLNXvw\" class=\"storyrightrail-bucket poster-ad-asset2-module story-poster-ad-asset2-module\"></section></aside></div>",

Plus-size shoppers are underserved by apparel chains and demand for that clothing is expected to grow, according to Marshal Cohen, an apparel industry analyst with research firm The NPD Group.</p><p>&#x201C;If you&#x2019;re in the plus-size business in a good, strong healthy way it&#x2019;s a great business to be in,&#x201D; he said.</p><p>Ashley Stewart, Cohen said, was ahead of the rest of the industry in realizing that plus-size customers want&#xA0;the same fashions as everyone else, not &#x201C;muu-muus and sweatpants.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;They want to wear skinny, tight athletic-inspired clothes. They want to wear bold print dresses. All the trends that are popular the plus-size consumer wants to wear,&#x201D; he said.</p><h2 class=\"presto-h2\">&quot;Size is secondary&quot;</h2><p>Kristen Gaskins, president and chief merchandising officer of Ashley Stewart, agrees. &#x201C;Size is secondary,&#x201D; she said, adding that the brand wants to be known for its fashions first, with &#x201C;oh yeah, and they are plus size&#x201D; an afterthought. The company has even gotten requests to start selling its clothes in smaller sizes, Gaskins said, but it has no interest in that. For Ashley Stewart, she said, fashion starts at size 12, and goes up to size 26 in stores, with up to size 36 available online.</p><p>Another advantage plus-size shoppers have, Cohen said, is they are extremely loyal to retailers who have been good to them.</p><p>&#x201C;If you treat the plus-size consumer right you will never have a more loyal friend and customer,&#x201D; he said.</p><div id=\"module-position-P2CB89RzNqE\" class=\"story-asset image-asset\"><aside class=\"wide single-photo\"><img src=\"https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4818eec2cbd49218ef010c5736706b60f883d0dc/c=225-0-6183-4480&amp;r=x408&amp;c=540x405/local/-/media/2017/03/30/Bergen/NorthJersey/636264821287923158-033017-AshleyStewart-0349.jpg\" alt=\"Ashley Stewart Facilities Manager, Fatima Hakim of\" width=\"540\"><meta><meta><meta><p>Ashley Stewart Facilities Manager, Fatima Hakim of Queens by the cash register as she prepares for the store&apos;s opening at their new store in Newark.<meta>&#xA0;<span class=\"credit\">(Photo: Chris Pedota/NorthJersey.com)</span></p></aside></div><p>Ashley Stewart considers the devotion of its fans to be it biggest asset. &#x201C;We have one of the most loyal customer bases in the world,&#x201D; Rhee said. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t think that&#x2019;s an exaggeration.

In the three and a half years since that store closed, Newark fans of the brand have been asking the company to return to the city.</p><p>&#x201C;We always knew we wanted to return to Newark,&#x201D; said Gaskins.</p><h2 class=\"presto-h2\">Prototype store</h2><p>The store, in a new strip mall at 204 Springfield Avenue in the University Heights neighborhood, gave the company a chance to create a store prototype from the ground up. It was designed to reflect the brand&#x2019;s personality, and its website, with a pink, fuschia, black and white color scheme.</p><p>The 4,500 square foot store has spacious dressing rooms (&#x201C;Our customer tries everything on.

But they are also about storytelling &#x2013; whose story is most compelling and most believable. More importantly, a scandal is often defined by whose story is told first.</p><p>This is the problem with Bridgegate &#x2013; and for Bridget Anne Kelly and Bill Baroni, her co-defendant who was sentenced to two years behind bars.</p><p>Chris Christie was able to tell his side of the story first.&#xA0; Kelly (who is not related to this columnist) and Baroni waited far too long to speak &#x2013; more than three years.&#xA0; By then, the public already had formed a firm &#x2013; and, sadly, indelible &#x2013; image of them.</p><p>The plot was set.&#xA0; It was only a matter of time before Kelly and Baroni were convicted &#x2013; and, now, sentenced to prison.&#xA0; Yes, they promise to appeal.&#xA0; And Kelly bravely claims she will not be a &#x201C;scapegoat.&#x201D;&#xA0; But changing the plot of the Bridgegate narrative is, at best, an arduous and expensive legal climb.

Christie was mesmerizing, a mix of bombast, philosophy and vulnerability.</p><p>To be sure, Christie was foolish &#x2013; and not in a comic sense.&#xA0;He was pathetic.&#xA0;But Christie made others look more foolish &#x2013; and, in the case of Kelly, Christie called her a liar who betrayed him.</p><p>That narrative stuck &#x2013; in part because Kelly delayed stepping forward to combat it.</p><p>Christie was able to portray himself as a hardworking governor, who was brought to his political knees by the silly behavior of a coterie of aides.&#xA0;Yes, he said he should have paid attention more.&#xA0; But he relied on his circle of trust. &#xA0;And now the circle was broken.</p><p>This was an exaggeration, of course.</p><p><span class=\"exclude-from-newsgate\"><a href=\"http://www.northjersey.com/story/news/columnists/mike-kelly/2017/03/29/mike-kelly-elusive-costs-bridgegate/99748280/\"><strong>MIKE KELLY:</strong>&#xA0;The elusive costs of Bridgegate</a></span></p><p><span class=\"exclude-from-newsgate\"><a href=\"http://www.northjersey.com/story/opinion/columnists/alfred-doblin/2017/03/29/doblin-message-baroni-and-kelly-no-one-blame-but-yourselves/99791970/\"><strong>ALFRED DOBLIN:&#xA0;</strong>Message to Baroni and Kelly: No one to blame but yourselves</a></span></p><p>As we came to learn, Christie set a bullying tone in his governor&#x2019;s office.&#xA0;&#xA0; And that tone inspired his aides to misuse their offices &#x2013; and taxpayer-supported power &#x2013; to punish critics or even anyone who did not jump on board Christie&#x2019;s political bandwagon.</p><p>This bullying style by Christie planted the seeds of Bridgegate.&#xA0; That became apparent in testimony during the federal trial of Kelly and Baroni last fall.&#xA0; Indeed, Christie&#x2019;s name was mentioned so often by prosecutors and defense attorneys that even the most uninformed observer had to reasonably wonder why the governor managed to escape indictment.</p><p>New Jersey&#x2019;s chief federal prosecutor, U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman, who was abruptly dismissed several weeks ago by the Trump administration with dozens of other federal prosecutors who had been appointed by President Barack Obama, has never offered a detailed explanation of why Christie and other top gubernatorial aides were not charged.</p><p>Adding to the mystery, Fishman conceded that his office compiled a list of officials who knew about the Bridgegate scheme.&#xA0; But Fishman has rigorously fought legal efforts by The Record and other news organizations to release that list.</p><p>Is Christie&#x2019;s name on that list?&#xA0; Who knows?&#xA0; When asked, Fishman routinely explained that his investigators did not find enough evidence to prove &#x201C;beyond a reasonable doubt&#x201D; &#x2013; the standard for a criminal trial &#x2013; that Christie or anyone else was involved in Bridgegate.</p><p>That&#x2019;s an all-too-easy, boilerplate &#xA0;explanation &#x2013; especially in light of the recent ruling byBergen County&#x2019;s presiding municipal judge, Roy F. McGeady, that there was &#x201C;probable cause&#x201D; &#x2013; another standard for bringing criminal charges &#x2013; that Christie was guilty of the state crime of official misconduct.</p><p>What makes Judge McGeady&#x2019;s ruling so compelling is that it was based on testimony from the Brigegate trial by Kelly and a co-conspirator, David Wildstein, who pleaded guilty and testified against Kelly and Baroni. The Bergen County Prosecutors Office announced it would not follow McGeady&#x2019;s lead and investigate Christie.&#xA0;&#xA0; Like Fishman, the BCPO did not offer a detailed explanation, only claiming it could not prove the charge beyond a reasonable doubt.</p><p>Kelly&#x2019;s evidence &#x2013; the storyline she told too late &#x2013; is compelling.&#xA0; She claimed Christie knew about the Bridgegate plot &#x2013; and its potential traffic gridlock in Fort Lee &#x2014; before it unfolded but did not try to intervene. Wildstein also offered compelling testimony. He said Christie was informed about Fort Lee&#x2019;s traffic problems while they were taking place but did nothing.</p><p>In his initial news&#xA0;conference in January 2014, Christie insisted he had no idea of the Bridgegate plot.&#xA0;&#xA0; But as we learned from the trial, other gubernatorial aides became aware of the plot during the fall of 2013. That none of these aides talked to Christie about the legal and political implications of the scandal is hard to believe.</p><p>Months after that January 2014 news&#xA0;conference, Christie was able to solidify his see-no-evil storyline by hiring a private law firm &#x2013; at taxpayer expense &#x2013; to create a report that essentially absolved him of any guilt and instead depicted Kelly, Baroni and Wildstein as a devious trio.&#xA0;&#xA0; Kelly was held out for special contempt, depicted as overly emotional and flighty.</p><p>Kelly did not try to offer a counter-narrative, however.&#xA0; Neither did Baroni or Wildstein.</p><p>It turns out&#xA0;Wildstein was negotiating a plea bargain with federal authorities &#x2013; and also telling a story to the feds that implicated Kelly and Baroni.</p><p>Kelly and Baroni remained silent &#x2013; to the general public and to the FBI and to federal prosecutors. Their silence is now seen as a massive miscalculation.</p><p>With Wildstein crafting a narrative for federal prosecutors and Christie &#x2013; with the help of a law firm&#x2019;s report &#x2013; shaping the public&#x2019;s sense of what happened with his own narrative, it was easy to cast Baroni and Kelly as villains.&#xA0; Yes, the public came to see Christie as the man who set a bullying tone.&#xA0;&#xA0; But by holding back on their stories until the trial, it was hard for Kelly and Baroni to offer a convincing explanation that could help them escape conviction.</p><p>To be sure, Kelly and Baroni faced other problems, too.</p><p>Kelly&apos;s &#x201C;time for traffic problems&#x201D; email set the Bridgegate plot in motion.&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; But she likely did not &#x201C;green light&#x201D; the scheme as federal prosecutors still insisted during her sentencing hearing last week.&#xA0; Kelly was clearly a mid-level player in the governor&#x2019;s office.&#xA0; It&#x2019;s na&#xEF;ve and misguided to believe that she ordered the traffic gridlock in Fort Lee on her own.</p><p>At the same time, Baroni did not help his case by testifying falsely before the&#xA0;Legislature &#x2013; and later at his trial &#x2014; that the Fort Lee gridlock was really a &#x201C;traffic study&#x201D; by the Port Authority.&#xA0;&#xA0; Baroni, a sharp lawyer known for his incisive political instincts, should have known better,&#xA0;and he admitted as much in a sorrowful lament before he was sentenced last week.&#xA0; &#x201C;I failed,&#x201D; he said.</p><p>In his testimony during the trial, Baroni seemed trapped by a silly, false narrative of his own making. If he had offered to cooperate with federal authorities, perhaps he could have avoided prison.</p><p id=\"module-position-P2CETiYGXZQ\" class=\"story-asset\"><aside class=\"single-photo float\"><img src=\"https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a823c127c92a9e94be01b048b5e4f2d453df5915/c=0-0-2136-2848&amp;r=183&amp;c=0-0-180-240/local/-/media/2016/11/17/Bergen/NorthJersey/636149968660823041-MIKEKELLY.JPG\" alt=\"Mike Kelly\" width=\"180\"><meta><meta><meta><p>Mike Kelly<meta>&#xA0;<span class=\"credit\">(Photo: .)</span></p></aside></p><p>Hindsight is a cruel player in any tragedy.&#xA0; But one wonders what might have happened if Kelly called a news&#xA0;conference on that same day in January 2014&#xA0;as did Christie and called the governor a liar. &#xA0;Suppose she announced then that Christie knew about the traffic plot before it took place?</p><p>Would we be in this same, sad place &#x2013; watching two people facing prison, one of them a single mother of four who can not even pay her legal bills?</p><p>Bridget Anne Kelly says she has more to tell.</p><p>If this is true, it&#x2019;s time for her to start talking.</p><p>To contact Record columnist Mike Kelly:</p><p>Email:&#xA0; <a href=\"mailto:Kellym@northjersey.com\">Kellym@northjersey.com</a></p><p>Twitter:&#xA0; @MikeKellyColumn</p><p class=\"article-print-url\">Read or Share this story: https://njersy.co/2nEZQ2n</p></div>",

President Trump&#x2019;s false tweets that President Barack Obama wiretapped him.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">B.) President Trump&#x2019;s war on the news media.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">C.) Looming famine that threatens 20 million people in four countries.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Kind of answers itself, doesn&#x2019;t it?</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#x201C;We are facing the largest humanitarian crisis since the creation of the United Nations,&#x201D; <a href=\"http://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/usgerc-stephen-o-brien-statement-security-council-missions-yemen-south-sudan-somalia?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axiosam\">warned </a>Stephen O&#x2019;Brien, the U.N.&#x2019;s humanitarian chief. &#x201C;Without collective and coordinated global efforts, people will simply starve to death.&#x201D;</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">How is Trump responding to this crisis? By slashing humanitarian aid, increasing the risk that people starve in the four countries &#x2014; Yemen, South Sudan, Somalia and Nigeria. The result is a perfect storm: Millions of children tumbling toward famine just as America abdicates leadership and cuts assistance.</p>        \n    </div>\n    \n</div>\n\n<div class=\"story-body-supplemental\">\n    <div class=\"story-body story-body-2\">\n        <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" id=\"story-continues-2\">&#x201C;This is the worst possible time to make cuts,&#x201D; David Miliband, president of the International Rescue Committee, told me. He said that &#x201C;the great danger&#x201D; is a domino effect &#x2014; that the U.S. action encourages other countries to back away as well.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" id=\"story-continues-3\">The essence of the Trump budget released a few days ago is to cut aid to the needy, whether at home or abroad, and use the savings to build up the military and construct a wall on the border with Mexico.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">(Yes, that&#x2019;s the wall that Trump used to say Mexico would pay for. Instead, it seems it may actually be paid for by cutting meals for America&#x2019;s elderly and by reducing aid to starving Yemeni children.)</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">It&#x2019;s important to note that &#x201C;all of these crises are fundamentally man-made, driven by conflict,&#x201D; as Neal Keny-Guyer, C.E.O. of Mercy Corps, put it. And the U.S. bears some responsibility.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" id=\"story-continues-4\">In particular, the catastrophe in Yemen &#x2014; the country with the greatest number of people at risk of famine &#x2014; should be an international scandal. A Saudi-led coalition, backed by the United States, has imposed a blockade on Yemen that has left two-thirds of the population in need of assistance. In Yemen, &#x201C;to starve&#x201D; is transitive.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">The suffering there gets little attention, partly because Saudi Arabia mostly keeps reporters from getting to areas subject to its blockade. I&#x2019;ve been trying to enter since the fall, but the Saudi coalition controls the air and sea and refuses to allow me in. In effect, the Saudis have managed to block coverage of the crimes against humanity they are perpetrating in Yemen, and the U.S. backs the Saudis. Shame on us.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" id=\"story-continues-5\">Likewise, the government in South Sudan this month denied me a visa; it doesn&#x2019;t want witnesses to its famine.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">In the United States, humanitarian aid has been a bipartisan tradition, and the champion among recent presidents was George W. Bush, who started programs to fight AIDS and malaria that saved millions of lives. Bush and other presidents recognized that the reasons to help involve not only our values, but also our interests.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" id=\"story-continues-6\">Think what the greatest security threat was that America faced in the last decade. I&#x2019;d argue that it might have been Ebola, or some other pandemic &#x2014; and we overcame Ebola not with aircraft carriers but with humanitarian assistance and medical research &#x2014; both of which are slashed in the Trump budget.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" id=\"story-continues-7\">Trump&#x2019;s vision of a security threat is a Chinese submarine or perhaps an unauthorized immigrant, and that&#x2019;s the vision his budget reflects. But in 2017 some of the gravest threats we face are from diseases or narcotics that can&#x2019;t be flattened by a tank but that can be addressed with diplomacy, scientific research, and social programs inside and outside our borders.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" id=\"story-continues-8\">It&#x2019;s true that American foreign aid could be delivered more sensibly. It&#x2019;s ridiculous that one of the largest recipients is a prosperous country, Israel. Trump&#x2019;s budget stipulates that other aid should be cut, but not Israel&#x2019;s.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">The U.S. contributes less than <a href=\"http://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2017/03/12/the-ethics-and-practicalities-foreign-aid/lMmOVkMJdIzsByLLOGl0zL/story.html#comments\">one-fifth of 1 percent</a> of our national income to foreign aid, about half the proportion of other donor countries on average.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" id=\"story-continues-9\">Humanitarian aid is one of the world&#x2019;s great success stories, for the number of people living in extreme poverty has dropped by half since 1990, and more than 120 million children&#x2019;s lives have been saved in that period.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">Consider Thomas Awiapo, whose parents died when he was a child growing up in northern Ghana. Two of his younger brothers died, apparently of malnutrition. Then Thomas heard that a local school was offering meals for students, a &#x201C;school feeding program&#x201D; supported by U.S.A.I.D., the American aid agency, and Catholic Relief Services. Thomas went to the school and was offered daily meals &#x2014; on the condition that he enroll.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">&#x201C;I kept going to that little village school, just for the food,&#x201D; he told me. He became a brilliant student, went to college and earned a master&#x2019;s degree in the U.S. Today he works for Catholic Relief Services in Ghana, having decided he wants to devote his life to giving back.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\">I asked him what he thought of the Trump budget cutting foreign assistance. &#x201C;When I hear that aid has been cut, I&#x2019;m so sad,&#x201D; he answered. &#x201C;That food saved my life.&#x201D;</p><footer class=\"story-footer story-content\">\n    \n    </footer>\n        \n    </div>\n    \n</div>\n\n    \n    \n\n    \n\n</article></div>",
